# analysis_on_iris_dataset
The purpose of this work is to show the data on three different species of Iris flower. I decided to show the mean of each column and then split up the columns by 
each species and get the averages of each species. In doing so I found that on average the Iris-setosa sepal length is less than both the iris-versicolor and 
the Iris-Virginica, with the Iris-Virginica being the largest. Finding data on the sepal width, petal length and petal width can be found by repeating what I did.
The other purpose of this project was to show some pandas numpy and matplotlib.pyplot at work, simple analysis and simple visualization.
